Exercise 11: Write a program to display all prime numbers within a range

Note: A Prime Number is a whole number that cannot be made by multiplying other whole numbers

Examples:

6 is not a Prime Number because it can be made by 2Ã—3 = 6
37 is a Prime Number because no other whole numbers multiply together to make it.
Given:

start = 25
end = 50
Expected output:

Prime numbers between 25 and 50 are:
29
31
37
41
43
47
